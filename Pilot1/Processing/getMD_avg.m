% Get rough anatomical definitions of MD network ROIs

% load the anatomical definitions of a parcellation of the MD network 
% from Fedorenko, Duncan , & Kanwisher, 2013
% downloaded from imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/MDsystem. 
% This script will convert that nifti file into a new nifti in
% the same coordinate system of the MNI-average brain from freesurfer. 
% (all happens in TAL space).
% Next step is to project this file into subject (functional) space using
% alignment between MNI-average brain and subject anatomical.

% only need to run this once, it'll put a file in the
% main preprocessing folder which can be used for all subs.
